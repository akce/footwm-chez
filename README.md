# Welcome to footwm!

Footwm - Focus On One Thing Window Manager.

Footwm aims to efficiently manage multitudes of windows without the need for tab bars or getting in the way.

It does this by:
- Storing windows and desktops in Most Recently Used (MRU) order
- Providing menus to find, filter and then perform actions on those windows/desktops.

[EWMH]: https://specifications.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/wm-spec-latest.html "EWMH"
[ICCC]: https://www.x.org/docs/ICCCM/icccm.pdf

Footwm is written in mostly [r6rs](http://www.r6rs.org/) scheme (using [Chez Scheme]) and implements standard [EWMH] and [ICCC] hints where possible.

Footwm functionality is divided among these applications:
- footwm: the window manager client
- footkeys: keyboard handler
- footwin: [gtk3] menu for selecting and closing windows
- footdesk: [gtk3] menu for selecting and closing desktops
- footsh: command line client for manipulating footwm/[EWMH]/[ICCC] hints

Footwm does not provide an execution monitor. Using a terminal multiplexer like [tmux] is highly recommended instead (see HACKING below).

## How To Use

Or why footwm behaves as it does.

When I'm working, I tend to have a rough idea of the last few windows that I've been using. Storing the windows in most recently used order makes it easy to access.

The menus allow to search for a window/desktop just by typing. The menu removes items that don't match the text as it's being typed leaving the choice of options fairly quickly. Pressing ENTER while there are multiple matches pushes the current text to the filter stack allowing to AND join multiple texts. This can be done as many times as needed to arrive at the desired matches.

### Misc menu usage notes

footdesk & footwin: losing focus will close the menu.

footdesk & footwin: ESC will close the menu.

footwin: \<ALT>-DEL will close *every* window in the display list.

footdesk: typing the name of a desktop that does not exist and pressing ENTER will create that desktop.

## Dependencies

## Compiling and installing

The library source files may be compiled as library shared object files. To compile, issue the command:

    $ make 

The recommended install method is to use the Makefile. It provides targets to compile and install the library files, scripts, and keys config file. The locations are controlled by 4 variables:
- PREFIX: Base directory where everything is installed. Default: ~ (User home directory).
- LIBDIR: The base directory where footwm library files go. This is a directory that must be in CHEZSCHEMELIBDIRS. Default: $PREFIX/lib/csv<CHEZ-SCHEME-VERSION>
- BINDIR: The directory where executable scripts go. This directory should be in PATH. Default: $PREFIX/bin
- CONFDIR: The directory where configuration files are looked for. Default: ~/.foot

To install library source files to LIBDIR:

    $ make install-src

To install (and if necessary, compile) library shared-object files to LIBDIR:

    $ make install-so

To install the executable scripts to BINDIR. Note that the scripts are installed without their '.ss' suffix. eg, footwm.ss becomes footwm.

    $ make install-bin

To install library source, shared objects, and executables:

    $ make install

To install and customise footkeys config:

    $ make install-config
    $ $EDITOR ~/.foot/footkeysconfig.sls

The *install-config* target is special in that it's not done as part of *make install* as it's a destructive operation and has the potential to overwrite a customised configuration file. It's expected that this command will only be run once ever during the first install.

### Insert into .xinitrc.

The snippet below creates a new [tmux] session called *wm* and runs footwm and footkeys within it (as well as a couple of other useful services).

Note that you'll need to create a non-background process to stop xinit/startx from exiting.

```
    # Create wm tmux session, and hide the mouse.
    tmux new-session -s wm -d -n unclutter unclutter
    # Start the rxvt-unicode daemon.
    tmux new-window -t wm -n urxvtd urxvtd -o
    # Footwm keyboard manager.
    tmux new-window -t wm -n footkeys footkeys
    # Footwm window manager.
    tmux new-window -t wm -n footwm footwm

    # Non background process.
    env DISPLAY=:0 urxvt -name wm -e tmux attach-session -t wm
```

Optional: Install remaining dependencies ([irregex] & [gtk3]) for the menu apps.

## Hacking

The main apps are all set to break into the chez debugger on error. Running them within [tmux] (or other terminal multiplexer) allows access to the prompt from any console.

On catastrophic error, you may need to switch out of X into a virtual terminal and then attach.

    <CTRL>-<ALT>-F2
    host login: <username>
    Password: *****
    $ tmux attach -t wm
    # fix issue...
    # restart footwm (note that you'll probably have to specify DISPLAY :0)
    # optionally detach from session
    <CTRL>-b d
    # switch back to X.. usually on 1st or 7th virtual terminal
    <ALT>-F7

Footwm has no state. Instead it gathers all needed information from X properties on demand, so it should be possible (depending on the error) to restart the footwm process and resume after code has been modified.

The foot shell (footsh) also allows for easy manipulation of window state. Invoking footsh without arguments will run a new Chez cafe (ie, a REPL) with the main footwm libraries pre-loaded and all (except xlib) prefixed.

NOTE: xlib is not prefixed as it uses ftypes and redefining exported symbols can cause issues there.

It's always best here to refer to the source code for what is possible.

```
A limitation of footsh is that it won't manipulate footwm code, as experienced LISPers might expect.

Instead, footsh can alter X properties and footwm can react. As footwm is stateless (and only requires a restart), this has proved an effective developement model.

And for those perusing the code: the naming convention for functions tries to follow OBJECT-ATTRIBUTE. eg, (ewmh.window-desktop wid) refers to the desktop assigned to window wid.
